"Credo" from ALL I REALLY NEED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEM: FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY EDITION RECONSIDERED, REVISED, & EXPANDED WITH TWENTY-FIVE NEW ESSAYS by Robert Fulghum, copyright (C) 1986, 1988, 2003 by Robert L. Fulghum.

All I really need to know about how in live and what to do and how to be I learned in kindergarten. Wisdom was not at the top of the graduate school moutain, but there in the sand pile at school.

These are the things I learned:
- Share everything.
- Play fair.
- Don't hit people.
- Put things back where you found them.
- Clean up your own mess.
- Don't take things that aren't your.
- Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.
- Wash your hands before you eat.
- Flush.
- Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.
- Live a balanced life - learn some and think some and draw and paint and sing and dance and play and work every day some.
- Take a nap every afternoon.
- When you go out in the world, watch out for traffic, hold hands and stick together.
- Be aware of wonder. Remember the little seed in the Styrofoam cup: the roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody really knows how or why, but we are all like that.
- Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even the little seed in the Styrofoam cup - they all die. So do we.
- And then remember the Dick-and-Jane books and the first word you learned - the biggest word of all - LOOK.
- Everything you need to know is in there somewhere. The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation. Ecology and politics and equality and same living.
- Take any one of those items and extrapolate it into sophisticated adult terms and apply it to our family life or your work or goverment or your world and it holds true and clean and firm. Think what a better world it would be if we all - the whole world - had cookies and milk at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon and then lay down with our blackies for a nap. Or if all goverments had as a basic policy to always put things back where they found them and to clean up their own mess.

And it is still true, no matter how old you are, when you go out in the world, it is best to hold hands and stick together.

所有我应该知道的事——如何生活、处事、为人的方法，都是栈幼儿园里学会的。智慧不存在于学术顶峰的研究所，而是在幼儿园的沙堆里。

这些都是我学到的事情：
- 要和别人分享一切。
- 玩游戏要公平。
- 不可以打人。
- 用完东西后要放回原处。
- 弄乱了东西要自己整理。
- 不是自己的东西不要拿。
- 冒犯了别人要说对不起。
- 吃东西前要洗手。
- 上厕所后要冲水。
- 热饼干和冰牛奶对身体有益。
- 过平衡的生活。要学习知识，也要动动大脑，画图、着色、唱歌、跳舞、游戏和工作，每天都要做一些。
- 下午小睡片刻。
- 出门在外的时候，要注意交通、手牵手、大家一起走。
- 发现世界的奇妙。记得保丽龙杯里的小种子；它往下扎根、朝上发芽，没有人知道这如何发生、为什么存在，但我们也是这样生长。
- 金鱼、仓鼠和小白鼠，甚至是在保丽龙杯里的小种子——它们都会死，我们也一样。
- 还要记得你读过的书，以及你第一个学会的字，也是最重要的字——“看”。

所有你知道的一切，都能在某处发现——推己及人的同理心、爱、基本的卫生观念、环境生态、政治、平等和明智健全的生活之路。

用其中任何一项道理去推敲复杂的成人事务，把它应用在你的家庭、职场、政府或是你生活的世界，始终都是事实、清楚而历久不变。想一想，如果全世界的人们，下午三点左右都吃饼干、喝点牛奶，然后盖上毯子躺下来小睡片刻，或是所有的政府都遵守一项基本政策——永远把东西归还原处，并且收拾自己制造出来的混乱，这世界会有多美好呢。

还有，这依然是真的——无论你长到几岁，出门在外的时候，最好还是手牵手，大家一起走。
